# Queuing Starter Kit for JavaScript [<img align="right" alt="Deploy to Fastly" src="https://deploy.edgecompute.app/button"/>](https://deploy.edgecompute.app/deploy)

Park website visitors in a virtual queue to reduce the demand on your origins during peak times.

**For more details about other starter kits for Fastly Compute, see the [Fastly Documentation Hub](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/solutions/starters)**

[![A screenshot of the queue page for a ticketing website. It reads: Sometimes we have to restrict the number of people who can access our website at the same time, so that everything works properly. There are 46 people ahead of you in the queue.](screenshot.png)](https://queue-demo.edgecompute.app/index.html)

## Features

- Park visitors in a queue to limit the amount of active users on the website ‚è≥
- Ship queue analytics to [log endpoints](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/guides/integrations/logging) üîé
- Allow certain requests such as robots.txt, favicon to bypass the queue ü§ñ
- No client-side scripting required ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Getting started

1. If you haven't already, [sign up for Upstash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@upstash/redis) and create a Redis service.
2. Create a new directory for your application and switch to it. Initialize a Compute project using this starter kit.
   ```sh
   npm create @fastly/compute@latest -- --language=javascript --starter-kit=queue
   ```
3. Create the `upstash` backend, changing the default hostname to the one provided in the Upstash console.
4. Create the `protected_content` backend by accepting the default example host or setting your own.
5. Populate the `config` config store by following the prompts to configure Upstash and set a secret for signing cookies.
6. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy your queue to your Fastly account.

## Understanding the code

This starter is fully-featured, and requires some dependencies on top of the [`@fastly/js-compute`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastly/js-compute) npm package. The following is a list of the dependencies used:

- **[@upstash/redis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@upstash/redis)** - a REST-based Redis client for storing queue state. You could easily swap this for your own storage backend.
- **[jws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jws)** - a library for generating and validating [JSON Web Tokens](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519).

The starter will require a backend to be configured to send requests to once visitors have made it through the queue. For demonstration, the default is a public S3 bucket with some assets and an index page.

The template uses webpack to bundle `index.js` and its imports into a single JS file, `bin/index.js`, which is then wrapped into a `.wasm` file, `bin/index.wasm` using the `js-compute-runtime` CLI tool bundled with the `@fastly/js-compute` npm package, and bundled into a `.tar.gz` file ready for deployment to Compute.

## Design

When a visitor makes a request for the first time, we generate a signed JWT containing their _position_ in the queue, which is determined by fetching the current queue _length_ from Redis (`INCR queue:length`). This signed JWT is sent back to the visitor as an HTTP cookie.

On a regular basis, the current queue _cursor_ is updated in Redis (`INCR queue:cursor`). This effectively lets a user in. To show a visitor how many others are in front of them in the queue, we subtract the current queue _cursor_ from the _position_ saved in their JWT.

On subsequent requests, when a JWT is supplied, we verify the signature and extract the _position_ from the JWT. If the current queue _cursor_ is higher than the user's signed _position_, they will be allowed in.
